• Add some new features to the simpletron:
 ○ Error checking
 ○ Larger program memory (Instruction size may have to be expanded to deal with larger memory)
 ○ Create modulo (remainder) instruction
 ○ Create newline instruction
 ○ Create floating point handling instructions
 ○ Create string handling instructions
 ○ Add support for disk reads and writes

• Add call and return functionality to the Simple language
 ○ Think about doing this with mutable goto addresses
 ○ All addresses which make calls should have GOTOs to those
   addresses stored as constants.
 ○ A Call will break down into a LOAD/STORE/BRANCH
   The return branch call corresponding to the calling address
   will be loaded into the accumulator. This will then
   be stored in the address of the first Return call
   which is made after branching. Then the branch command
   will go to the call destination. Finally, control will
   be returned by the replaced branch command.
